/*
1. Verbose:
Definition: Something is described as verbose when it uses more words (or more lines of code) than necessary.
In programming: Verbose code means the code is longer or has more boilerplate (extra) information than is needed to achieve a task.
2. Concise:
Definition: Concise means expressing something in fewer words (or fewer lines of code) without losing meaning.
In programming: Concise code accomplishes the same task but in a shorter and more efficient manner, often by eliminating boilerplate code.

Differences of Anonymous class and Lambda Expression:
Verbosity: The anonymous class version is more verbose because you need to declare a new class and override the method
explicitly. The lambda version is more concise.

Readability: Lambda expressions improve code readability by reducing boilerplate code, especially when implementing
 functional interfaces (interfaces with only one abstract method).

Type inference: In the lambda version, you don't need to specify the method or class explicitlyâ€”Java can infer that
you're implementing the Runnable interface and the run() method.
